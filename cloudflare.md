### Benefits of CloudFlare + Blitz
Sign up for Blitz via CloudFlare in an instant with Single Sign-On (SSO) provisioning. If using Blitz load testing to test a site protected by CloudFlare, note that Blitz load testing ("rushes") must be directed to your origin server, so you can learn the real baseline limits of your application, without CloudFlare. This avoids triggering CloudFlare security.

In general, CloudFlare will improve the performance of your application or service beyond the limits you discover with Blitz because CloudFlare's delivery of your static content from its global network dramatically frees up server resources and connections for use by your application.

### Features

#### No Scripting

Blitz eliminates the expensive and tedious script creation process. Developers can instantly load test their APIs and cloud apps without creating complex test scripts. With the Google Chrome extension, integration with Google Analytics, and integration with all leading Platform As A Service platforms.

#### Continuous Integration

With support for Ruby, Java, Python, node.js, etc. and a robust API, application and API developers can integrate Blitz into their continuous deployment process.

#### Multi-Location Load Testing

Blitz can run load tests constituting millions of concurrent users coming from multiple continents. Combined with parameterization of API invocations, Blitz makes it possible to accurately re-create users from around the world.
